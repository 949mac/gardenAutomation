# gardenAutomation

I'm new to github and writing code in general so please bear with me. 

This Home Assistant project is now running on a Raspberry Pi 4 and is a mish-mash of components. It currently controls climate, pH dosing, 
and nutrient dosing (new batches only). I've added the Home Assistant configuration files and will get around to adding the Arduino code 
running on the Mega and ESPs eventually.
